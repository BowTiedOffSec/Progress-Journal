The past few days have been focused on **Cyfrin Updraft** and diving into Solidity basics through projects like **Simple Storage**. Progress has been steady, although concepts like structs and arrays have required some extra attention to really grasp. Alongside this, I’ve been working through **CryptoZombies**—which, at this stage, is proving to be a great complement to my learning.

Balancing a full-time role outside of tech, family commitments, and my Web 3 learning journey isn’t easy, but I’m finding it incredibly rewarding. I’m also expanding my knowledge in **yield farming** and experimenting with DeFi tools, plus gaining hands-on experience with bots and tracking tools on the **Solana blockchain**.

Every step, no matter how small, brings me closer to my goals. Building skills in Web 3 is a long game, but I’m committed to making progress each day and moving closer to a full-time role in the field.  Eventually, I will likely start a medium account to track this journal but for now, this will do.  Take care out there!
